# PickMeUp-Decode-Congestion-Hackathon-
PickMeUp, A new centralized carpooling platform that allows individuals to find/provide rides in Vancouver's most congested areas.  Vancouver public transportation has a common problem; busses are often too saturated with people, resulting in delays. These delays are what navigation apps such as Google Maps cannot predict, and often lead to unscheduled conflicts.   PickMeUp is aiming to fix that problem. We use the given data to calculate the most congested bus stops in Vancouver and establish pick-up points near them. This act of carpooling reduces the number of cars on the street, which increases road safety, reduces congestion, and gives the earth a huge break!  Affordability is also a key selling point of this app. The price of carpooling with others will be cheaper than ride-hailing alternatives, but much faster than public transportation.  The sleek, simple user interface of this app makes it aesthetic to the eye, and easy to navigate around.
